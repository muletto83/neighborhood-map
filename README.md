# Instructions
To get started please follow these steps:

* Clone or download this project
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Launch the app `npm start`

Once ready a new browser window should automatically open, otherwise you can visit: http://localhost:3000/

**Note that the default service worker is used in this app (bootstrapped with create-react-app) and so it only works in production build.**

## Features
A map of the best places to eat around my house:
- Keyboard Tab improved to work for a11y
- Filter input to filter the restaurant from that list and automatically filter the map markers
- Responsive for major devices
- Map has marker and Infowindows to get info for the specific restaurant
